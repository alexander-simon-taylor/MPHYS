MPHYS project code
Written by Alex Taylor and Sam Davis

The aim of this code was to generate data and results for our project "Modelling Chaotic Magnetic Fields in Plasmas".
This code takes a variety of initial conditions (IC) and parameters, and outputs data files and various graphs
These ICs and parameters are given in the "driver.m" file.

(ToDo, finish this ReamMe)
